# Live coding challenge - fetch images from NASA Mars Rover API


Create a command line program that will fetch images from NASA Mars Rover Photos API 
and store them locally for a given date. If images for a date already exit, they should 
not be downloaded again.

You're free to use any library you like, but do not use a full framework.

Documentation can be seen here: https://api.nasa.gov, under "Mars Rover Photos".
You can generate an API key on the same page, under "Generate API Key".
