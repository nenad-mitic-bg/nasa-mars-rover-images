# Live coding challenge - fetch images from NASA Mars Rover API


Create a command line application that will fetch images from NASA Mars Rover Photos API
and store them locally for a given date. Date should be passed as an argument to the app.
If images for a date already exit, they should not be downloaded again.

You can use `fetch-images.php` as a starting point of the application.

You're free to use any library you like, but do not use a full framework.

Keep in mind that the code should be unit testable.

Documentation can be seen here: https://api.nasa.gov, under "Mars Rover Photos".
You can generate an API key on the same page, under "Generate API Key".
